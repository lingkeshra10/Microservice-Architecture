# Microservice-Architecture

Microservice architecture it refers as micro architural style for developing the application. Microservice allow huge organization application to be separated into smaller independent services with each parts having its own realm of responsibilty and works together with other services to serve with better performance.

In monolithic app, all the services will bundle in together which one service is down, the other services will crashed. The structure of monolithic architecure will be huge and complicated where all the services will be dependent with each other. The microservice architecture is collabrating with each order to serve the functions of the huge monolithic applications.

In microservice architecture, container will be widely used in order to increase the performance and manage its own services among the container.
